	<br>
	<p style="text-align:left;">City in Karnataka</p>
	<p>Bangalore (/bæŋɡəˈlɔːr/), officially known as Bengaluru (Kannada pronunciation: [ˈbeŋɡəɭuːɾu]), is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Karnataka.It has a population of more than 8 million and a metropolitan population of around 11 million, making it the third most populous city and fifth most populous urban agglomeration in India. Located in southern India on the Deccan Plateau, at a height of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, Bangalore is known for its pleasant climate throughout the year. Its elevation is the highest among the major cities of India.
	<br>	<br>The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore. The Begur inscription is written in Halegannada (ancient Kannada), mentions 'Bengaluru Kalaga' (battle of Bengaluru). It was a significant turning point in the history of Bangalore as it bears the earliest reference to the name 'Bengaluru'. In 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or petes, which exist to the present day. After the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th century, the Mughals sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore for three lakh rupees. When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands.
	<br>	<br>The city was captured by the British East India Company after victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the Princely State of Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following India's independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore – city and cantonment – which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing Kannada name, Bengalūru, was declared the official name of the city in 2006.
	<br>	<br>Bangalore is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter. Indian technological organisations are headquartered in the city. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in India. Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Bangalore either the fourth- or fifth-most productive metro area of India.As of 2017, Bangalore was home to 7,700 millionaires and 8 billionaires with a total wealth of $320 billion.It is home to many educational and research institutions. Numerous state-owned aerospace and defence organisations are located in the city. The city also houses the Kannada film industry. It was ranked the most liveable Indian city with a population of over a million under the Ease of Living Index 2020.</p>

        <h2><br>Etymology</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The name "Bangalore" is an anglicized rendition of the original Kannada name "Bengalūru" (ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು, [ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru]). Kempegowda used it to christen the city, with its roots in the village of Bengalūru near Kodigehalli. The earliest instance of "Bengalūru" is in a 9th-century Western Ganga dynasty stone inscription on a vīra gallu, praising a warrior's virtues. This inscription from Begur notes "Bengalūrū" as the site of a battle in 890 CE. The inscription reveals that the place was part of the Ganga Kingdom until 1004 and was known as "Bengaval-uru," meaning the "City of Guards" in Halegannada (Old Kannada).<br>
        
         <br>   According to a legendary tale, during a twelfth century hunting expedition, Hoysala king Veera Ballala II lost his way and encountered an elderly woman in the forest. She offered him boiled beans when he was tired and hungry. Grateful for her help, the king dubbed the location "benda-kaal-uru," signifying "town of boiled beans," which later transformed into "Bengalūru." An alternate interpretation by Suryanath Kamath suggests a floral source, linking the name to "benga," the Kannada word for Pterocarpus marsupium (Indian Kino Tree). This species of dry and moist deciduous trees flourished in the region.<br>
        
         <br>   On 11 December 2005, the Karnataka Government endorsed Jnanpith Award recipient U. R. Ananthamurthy's suggestion to rename Bangalore as Bengalūru. Subsequently, on 27 September 2006, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) adopted a resolution to enact the proposed name alteration. The Karnataka government endorsed the proposal, setting 1 November 2006 as the official implementation date for the change. In October 2014, the Union government approved this request, along with name adjustments for 11 other cities in Karnataka. Consequently, on 1 November 2014, Bangalore was officially renamed "Bengaluru."</p>
        <h2><br>History</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Early and medieval history</h3>
        
        <br>
        <p>Stone Age artifacts were discovered during India's 2001 census in Jalahalli, Sidhapura, and Jadigenahalli, now on the outskirts of Bangalore. This points to a potential human settlement around 4000 BCE. Around 1,000 BCE, during the Iron Age, burial grounds emerged in Koramangala and Chikkajala on Bangalore's outskirts. The uncovering of Roman coins from emperors Augustus, Tiberius, and Claudius in Yeswanthpur and HAL suggests the region engaged in trans-oceanic trade with Romans and other civilizations in 27 BCE.<br>
        
           <br> The area that encompasses present-day Bangalore was under the dominion of successive South Indian realms. From the 4th to the 10th centuries, the Western Ganga dynasty of Karnataka held sway over Bangalore, being the first dynasty to assert effective control. Edgar Thurston notes twenty-eight monarchs who ruled Gangavadi, within which Bangalore was located, from the inception of the Christian era until its subjugation by the Cholas. These rulers belonged to two distinct lineages: the earlier Solar dynasty with seven Ratti or Reddi tribe monarchs, and the subsequent Ganga dynasty. Initially autonomous (350–550), the Western Gangas later became vassals of the Chalukyas of Badami and then the Rashtrakutas, until the 10th century.

           <br> <br>Around 860 CE, during the reign of the Western Ganga King Ereganga Nitimarga I, the Begur Nageshwara Temple was commissioned. It was later expanded under his successor Nitimarga II. In approximately 1004, during the rule of Raja Raja Chola I, the Cholas vanquished the Western Gangas, led by crown prince Rajendra Chola I, and took control of Bangalore. This epoch saw the influx of diverse groups — warriors, administrators, traders, artisans, pastoralists, cultivators, and religious figures — migrating from Tamil Nadu and other Kannada-speaking regions.
            
           <br> <br>Notable architectural vestiges from the Chola period include the Chokkanathaswamy temple at Domlur, the Aigandapura complex near Hesaraghatta, Mukthi Natheshwara Temple at Binnamangala, Choleshwara Temple at Begur, and Someshwara Temple at Madiwala.<br>
        
           <br> In 1117, the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana achieved victory over the Cholas in the Battle of Talakad in south Karnataka, thus expanding Hoysala control over the area. Vishnuvardhana successfully ousted the Cholas from all regions of Mysore state. By the late 13th century, Bangalore emerged as a focal point of contention between two feuding cousins: Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III of Halebidu and Ramanatha, who governed from Hoysala-held land in Tamil Nadu.

          <br>  Veera Ballala III elevated the status of Bangalore by appointing a civic leader in Hudi, a region now within Bangalore Municipal Corporation limits. After Veera Ballala III's demise in 1343, the Vijayanagara Empire took over the region's governance. Within the Vijayanagara Empire's rule, four dynasties came to prominence: the Sangamas (1336–1485), Saluvas (1485–1491), Tuluvas (1491–1565), and Aravidu (1565–1646).
            
          <br>  During the Vijayanagara Empire's reign, Achyuta Deva Raya of the Tuluva dynasty engineered the construction of the Shivasamudra Dam across the Arkavati River at Hesaraghatta. This reservoir now supplies the city with regular piped water.</p><br>
        <h3>Foundation and early modern history</h3><br>
        <p>Modern Bangalore's origin traces back to 1537, initiated by Kempe Gowda I, a vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire. He allied with the empire against Gangaraja, built a mud-brick fort, and established a town, laying the groundwork for contemporary Bangalore. However, Achuta Deva Raya's concerns restrained Kempe Gowda I, preventing the construction of a formidable stone fort. He fondly referred to the town as his "gandubhūmi" or "Land of Heroes."

          <br><br> Within the fort, Bangalore was divided into smaller divisions called "pete." The town featured Chikkapeté Street running east-west and Doddapeté Street running north-south. Their junction formed the Doddapeté Square, the town's core. Kempe Gowda II, his successor, constructed four boundary-marking towers. During Vijayanagara rule, Bangalore was known as "Devarāyanagara" and "Kalyānapura."
            
           <br> <br>Post the Vijayanagara Empire's fall in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota, Bangalore witnessed shifts in power. Kempe Gowda declared independence, but in 1638, the Adil Shahi Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III. Subsequently, Bangalore was granted to Shāhji Bhōnslé as a jagir. In 1687, it changed hands again, this time to the Mughal general Kasim Khan, who sold it to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar for three lakh rupees.
            
           <br> <br>After the reign of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Hyder Ali emerged as the de facto ruler of Mysore. Hyder Ali built the Delhi and Mysore gates in 1760, fortifying Bangalore. The city flourished under his rule and that of his son, Tipu Sultan, who contributed by establishing the Lal Bagh Botanical Gardens in 1760.
            
          <br> <br> The British captured the Bangalore fort during the Third Anglo-Mysore War in 1791. After Tipu Sultan's defeat in 1799, the British handed administrative control of the city back to the Maharaja of Mysore, integrating it into the Princely State of Mysore under the British Raj. The British moved their cantonment to Bangalore in 1809, spurring its growth. Important developments like telegraph connections to major Indian cities in 1853 and a rail link to Madras in 1864 propelled the city's rapid expansion..</p>

        <p style="text-align:left;">Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya KCIE FASc(15 September 1860 – 14 April 1962),more commonly known as Sir MV, was an Indian civil engineer, statesman and the 19th Diwan of Mysore, serving from 1912 to 1919.He started his primary education in Bangalore,still that stands as United Mission School and he pursued his degree from one of the best and the 3rd oldest engineering college in Asia, College of Engineering, Pune. He received India's highest honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1955. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the British Indian Empire (KCIE) by King George V for his contributions to the public good. His birthday, 15 September, is celebrated as Engineers' Day in India, Sri Lanka and Tanzania in his memory. He was the Chief Engineer of Krishna Raja Sagara dam in the north-west suburb of Mysuru city, Laxmi Talav dam in the south-west Maharashtra Radanagari Kolhapur and also served as one of the Chief Engineers of the flood protection system for the city of Hyderabad.<br></p>
            <br><h4>Biography</h4><br>
            <p>Born into a Telugu Brahmin family in Mokshagundam village, Andhra Pradesh, Visvesvaraya's parents were Mokshagundam Srinivasa Shastry and Venkatalakshamma. However, he himself hailed from Muddenahalli in the Mysore Kingdom, present-day Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka. Starting as an assistant engineer in the Bombay Public Works Department, he was later invited to join the Indian Irrigation Commission.

              <br><br>  Innovating in irrigation, he introduced a sophisticated system on the Deccan Plateau. He also designed automatic weir water floodgates, patented in 1903, initially employed at Khadakvasla Reservoir near Pune. These gates boosted reservoir storage without risking dam damage. They were subsequently used at Tigra Dam in Gwalior and Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) Dam in Mandya, Karnataka. The Government of India commissioned him to study Aden's water supply and drainage systems in 1906–1907, which he successfully executed.
                
                Visvesvaraya gained prominence by creating flood protection for Hyderabad and devising a sea erosion defense system for Visakhapatnam port. He left an indelible mark with the construction of the largest reservoir in Asia. Notably, he contributed his technical insights to the location of the Mokama Bridge over the Ganga in Bihar when he was over 90 years old.
                
                His role extended into the Government of Mysore, leading to the establishment of Mysore Soap Factory, Parasitoid Laboratory, Mysore Iron & Steel Works (now Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel Limited) in Bhadravathi, Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic Bangalore, Bangalore Agricultural University, State Bank of Mysore, Century Club, Mysore Chamber of Commerce, and more. As the Diwan of Mysore, he encouraged private industrial investments and devised plans for road construction between Tirumala and Tirupati. He fostered the love for Kannada, founding Kannada Parishat and supporting seminars in Kannada. The Bangalore Press and Bank of Mysore were founded during his tenure. Renowned for his dedication, time management, and integrity, Visvesvaraya is revered as the "Father of Modern Mysore State."</p><br>
        <h2>Geography</h2><br>
        <p>Situated in the southeastern part of Karnataka, Bangalore is nestled within the Mysore Plateau, a region of the expansive Cretaceous Deccan Plateau. The average elevation of the city is approximately 900 m (2,953 ft), with geographical coordinates at 12°58′44″N 77°35′30″E. Covering an expanse of 741 km2 (286 sq mi), the major portion of Bangalore is encompassed by the Bangalore Urban district, while the surrounding rural lands are included in the Bangalore Rural district. Furthermore, the creation of the new Ramanagara district has resulted from the division of the original Bangalore Rural district.
<br>
            The city's landscape generally presents a level terrain, with the western areas having some hilly features. The highest point, Vidyaranyapura Doddabettahalli, stands at 962 m (3,156 ft) and resides in the northwestern region. Though significant rivers do not flow directly through Bangalore, the Arkavathi and South Pennar rivers intersect at the Nandi Hills, located 60 km (37 mi) to the north. Within Bangalore, River Vrishabhavathi, a minor tributary of Arkavathi, originates in Basavanagudi and traverses the city. The combined flow of Arkavathi and Vrishabhavathi carries much of the city's sewage. A comprehensive sewerage network, constructed in 1922, spans 215 km2 (83 sq mi) of Bangalore and links with five sewage treatment facilities situated at the city's outskirts.
            
        <br>    Kempe Gowda I, in the 16th century, designed numerous lakes to fulfill the town's water necessities. One of the prominent lakes of that era was the Kempambudhi Kere, although urban development has since encroached upon it. In the early 20th century, the Nandi Hills waterworks was established under the direction of Sir Mirza Ismail, the Diwan of Mysore from 1926 to 1941, aiming to supply water to the city. The Kaveri River contributes to around 80% of Bangalore's water supply, while the remaining 20% is sourced from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta reservoirs of the Arkavathi River. With a daily influx of 800 million liters (211 million US gallons), Bangalore boasts the highest water supply among Indian cities. Nevertheless, water scarcity is encountered at times, particularly during the dry summer months and in years of inadequate rainfall.
            
         <br>   The city endures air pollution, with an air quality index (AQI) study revealing scores ranging from 76 to 314 across twenty monitoring stations. This suggests varying degrees of pollution, particularly around areas with high traffic density.
            
          <br>  Bangalore boasts a selection of freshwater lakes and water tanks, with notable ones including Madivala tank, Hebbal Lake, Ulsoor Lake, Yediyur Lake, and Sankey Tank. Groundwater is found in the alluvial sediment layers, ranging from silty to sandy textures. The Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) dominates the rock formations in the region, encompassing granites, gneisses, and migmatites. As for soil composition, the soils of Bangalore consist primarily of red laterite and red, fine loamy to clayey soils.<br>
        
        Vegetation in the city is primarily in the form of large deciduous canopy and minority coconut trees. Though Bangalore has been classified as a part of the seismic zone II (a stable zone), it has experienced quakes of magnitude as high as 4.5.</p>
        <br><h2>Climate</h2><br>
        <p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://detailspagebangalore.blob.core.windows.net/images/climate.png" width="75%"></p>
        <p>Bangalore experiences a tropical savanna climate classified as Köppen climate type Aw, marked by distinct wet and dry seasons. Thanks to its elevated position, the city typically enjoys a relatively moderate climate year-round, though occasional heatwaves can lead to discomfort during summer. January stands as the coolest month, boasting an average low temperature of 15.1°C (59.2°F), while April claims the hottest month title with an average high temperature of 35°C (95°F). The highest recorded temperature in Bangalore was 39.2°C (103°F) on 24 April 2016, attributed to a potent El Niño effect that year. On the same day, unofficial records reached up to 41°C (106°F). In contrast, the lowest temperature on record was 7.8°C (46°F) in January 1884. Winter temperatures seldom dip below 14°C (57°F), while summer temperatures rarely exceed 36°C (97°F).

           <br> Bangalore experiences rainfall from both the northeast and southwest monsoons, with the wettest months typically being September, October, and August, respectively. The summer heat is often alleviated by frequent thunderstorms, which may occasionally lead to power interruptions and localized flooding. Rainfall predominantly occurs in the late afternoon, evening, or at night, with morning rain being infrequent. Notably, November 2015 recorded significant rainfall of 290.4 mm, resulting in severe flooding in certain areas and causing several organizations to shut down temporarily. The heaviest recorded rainfall within a 24-hour span occurred on 1 October 1997, totaling 179 mm (7 inches).</p>
        <br><h2>Culture</h2>
